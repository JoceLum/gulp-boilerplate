//make sure gulp is running
//make your changes
//changes should include the removal of /public/styles/style.css and /public/scripts/main.js (so that we are no longer ignoring our compiled code)
//quit gulp (crtl c)
//add, commit, and push our changes to master branch

//git checkout -b gh-pages (this creates a new branch called gh-pages)
//push our updated code from master branch into gh-pages by running the following command: git push origin gh-pages
//go back to your github repo for this project, navigate to settings, and under 'Github Pages', you should see a link to your live site (this can take awhile to propagate)
